# Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

## Steps
1. **Download Dataset**: Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset (Wisconsin Diagnostic).
2. **Preprocess Data**: Clean, label, and split the data into training and test sets.
3. **Model Training**: Train a Random Forest classifier to predict issue priority (high/medium/low).
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy and F1-score.
5. **Deliverables**:
   - Jupyter Notebook with code and results
   - Performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score)
   - Screenshot of results (to be added)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter

## Usage
Run the notebook `breast_cancer_predictive_analytics.ipynb` for the full workflow.
